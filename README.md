Caliban is a purely functional library for building GraphQL servers and clients in Scala.
 
The design principles behind the library are the following:
- minimal amount of boilerplate: no need to manually define a schema for every type in your API.
- high performance: while every public interface is pure and immutable, library internals have been optimized for speed.
- clean separation between schema definition and implementation: schema is defined and validated at compile time using Scala standard types, resolver (`RootResolver`) is a simple value provided at runtime.
